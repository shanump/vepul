            <strong>Malabar Antique</strong> were established in 1989 at Thazheyangadi the Old Vadakara town. 
            We take great pride in continuing the tradition established by our parents, Malabar Antique is currently operated by Mr. Majeed.

            After that, in 2016, another initiative called <strong>Craft Decor</strong> started funtioning in Iringal near by National Highway 66 (Vadakara - Kozhikode route). 
            It works well with a large number of items in a spacious building.
